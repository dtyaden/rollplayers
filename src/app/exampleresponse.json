content: "<p>Dungeon World sure can get weird, huh?  In this episode, Zinks, Dim and Jack find themselves caught up in a plot riddled with holes when they come up against more members of the Pepcee Cartel.  Do you like Bar Fights, Assassination plots, and stinky sewers?  Well you're in luck, because this group, not only encounters all three, but they manage to inspire a nation... or at least one dwarf to start a revolution.  Did I mention they accidentally come up with a powerful new group name? </p>"
